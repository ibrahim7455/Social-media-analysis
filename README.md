 # Assessment Overview:
 I analyzed a dataset with metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and views for posts across multiple platforms. The goal was to answer questions on engagement, post types, and quarterly trends.
 Key Insights:

Total Engagement: Likes, shares, comments, and views were meticulously summed up for each quarter.

Platform Performance: Discovered which platform led in engagement using the formula: Engagement = Likes + Shares + Comments.

Post Efficiency: Calculated average engagement metrics per post and identified the top-performing post types.

Content Strategy: Analyzed the distribution of post types and their success across different platforms.

# Excel Power: 
 With Excel, I was able to transform raw data into actionable insights, visualize trends, and provide recommendations for boosting social media strategy

  Excel also helped me add new important insights to the data, such as engagements, and also the quarters for each year available in the data.
